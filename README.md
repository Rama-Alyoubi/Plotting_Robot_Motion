# Plotting_Robot_Motion
### There are two files for this project
- plot.php: This code creates a web page with a canvas and a form to draw a line on the canvas. The user selects a direction and enters a length, and when they click the "Draw Route" button, a line with an arrowhead is drawn on the canvas in the selected direction and length.

- connect.php: This code connects to a database named plot_path, retrieves data from the array containing the selected direction and length from the form on a previous web page, and inserts this data into a table named path in the database.
